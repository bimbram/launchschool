# What's a Symbol?
#===============================================================================
#
# -Ruby symbol is a sort of name
# -Symbols aren't strings
# -The key behavior which differentiate symbol and string is: while there can be
# multiple different strings that all have the same value, there's only one copy
# of any particular symbol at a given time
# -The '.object_id' method gets the ID of an object - it's how Ruby knows whether
# two objects are the exact same object
#

#
# 1. The .object_id method gets the ID of an objectâ€”it's how Ruby knows whether
#    two objects are the exact same object. Run the code in the editor to see that
#    the two "strings" are actually different objects, whereas the :symbol is the
#    same object listed twice.
