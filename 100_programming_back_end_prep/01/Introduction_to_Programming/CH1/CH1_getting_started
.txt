00. Introduction
================

A Brief History of Ruby
------------------------
-Ruby emphasize that software should concerns human first and computers second

Computers Science and Layers of Abstraction
-------------------------------------------
-Abstraction is a technique for arranging complexity in the computer system.

-There can be levels to abstraction, each level has different degree of complexity

-The higher we're on the abstraction chain, the simpler/easier it is for us to
understand its complexity

-Every programming language is based on other lower level layers of code

-Domain Specific Language example: rails, Rspec


Who This Book is For
--------------------
-Programming requires us to be patience.

-A task difficulty will decrease the more time we invest into investigate that
task

How to Read This Book
--------------------
-There is a muscle memory aspect to computer programming that can only be strengthen
by actually doing the code

-Do all the exercise in the book to practice that programming muscle memories


01. Preparations
================
-User ruby 1.9.3 or higher

Using a Code Editor
-------------------
-Use atom

Stylish Ruby
-------------
-more info about Ruby style guide: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide

Reading Documentation
---------------------
-API: application programming interface
-API refer to how application talk to each other or documentation

*Class name or Module name
-In some documentation, class name is being referred to with a :: symbol
like: Encoding::Converter
-The :: symbol is used to define a namespace
-namespace is a way to group classes in Ruby and differentiate from other classes
with the same name
-The :: at the method list means that :: is a class method

*Methods
-:: are considered class methods
-# are considered instance methods
-the ::,# are completely different in Ruby documentation and in the actual code
-in the actual code # means comment and :: is used as a namespace

*Example: Instance Methods vs Class Methods
-public instance methods can be applied to any instance of the class

*Parent
-String class's parent is Object, and it inherit the methods of the Object

*Class/Module Index
-The menu is a list of all the other classes and modules that are part of the same
namespace as the current class

*Included Modules
-Indicate additional modules whose functionality is available ot the String class

*Summary
-When in doubt, review the ruby docs at www.ruby-doc.org that match the version
of ruby we're working with

Using the Command Line and irb
--------------------------

*Command Line
-simple terminal command

*irb
-irb is a Ruby built in interactive environment

*Running Ruby Code
-ruby example.rb
-When we run a Ruby file from the command line, the code gets executed by what's
called an interpreter

What Are Ruby "Gems"?
---------------------
-Gems or RubyGems can mean two things
1. a collection of ruby files or ruby library that performs a certain task
2. publishing system that is behind organizing, listing, and publishing those libraries

-The publishing system behind rubygems is powered by the website: rubygems.org
