# Learning to Yield
#===============================================================================
#
# -Why do some methods accept a block and others don't? it's because methods that
# accept blocks have a way of transferring control from the calling method to the
# block and back again.
# -We can build this into the methods we define by using the yield keyword

# 1. Check out the code in the editor. We've set up a series of puts statements
#    so you can see when we're in the block_test method and when we're in the block
#    passed to it. Click Run to see the result!

def block_test
  puts "We're in the method!"
  puts "Yielding to the block..."
  yield
  puts "We're back in the method!"
end

block_test { puts ">>> We're in the block!" }
