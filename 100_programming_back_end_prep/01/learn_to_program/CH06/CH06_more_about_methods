-arithmetic operator are methods

-in Ruby we've always been inside a special object Ruby has created for us that
represents the whole program called self

-Every method is being done by some object even if it doesn't have a dot in front
of it

-some string method: .reverse .length .upcase .downcase .swapcase .capitalize
.center .ljust (left justify) .rjust (right justify)

-other arithmetic operator: exponentiation (**), modulus (%)

-absolute value method: .abs

-random value method: .rand

-returning the same random value: .srand

-the Math object method: Math::PI, Math::E, Math.cos, Math.tan, Math.log

-:: is the scope operator
