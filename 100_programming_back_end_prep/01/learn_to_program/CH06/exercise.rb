Write an angry boss program that rudely asks what you want. Whatever you answer,
the angry boss should yell it back to you and then fire you. For example, if you
type in I want a raise, it should yell back like this:
"WHADDAYA MEAN "I WANT A RAISE"?!? YOU'RE FIRED!!"
=end

puts "What do you want?"

answer = gets.chomp

puts "WHADDAYA MEAN \"#{answer.upcase}\"?!? YOU\'RE FIRED!!"

puts "Chapter 1:  Getting Started" + "page  1".rjust(20)
puts "Chapter 2:  Numbers" + "page  2".rjust(28)
puts "Chapter 3:  Letters" + "page 13".rjust(28)
