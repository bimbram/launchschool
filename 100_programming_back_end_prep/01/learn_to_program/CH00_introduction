-In any communication with humans, you can leave out all sorts of steps or concepts
and let them fill in the gaps. Computer can't do this.

What is Programming
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Programming is telling your computer to do something.
-In programming, large task must be broken up into smaller tasks down to the most
basic task that you don't have to describe

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programming Languages
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Ruby is a relatively simple programming language than other languages such as Java

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Art of Programming
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-A program is not built; it is grown
-Because program is always growing and changing, it must be written with change in mind

-Avoid duplication of code at all costs (DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself)

-A good programmer cultivates the virtues of laziness. (But not just any laziness.
You must be aggressively, proactively lazy!) save yourself work whenever possible.
