# -One of the main purposes of modules is to separate methods and constants into
# named spaces. This is called (conveniently enough) namespacing, and it's how Ruby
# doesn't confuse Math::PI and Circle::PI
# -The double colon :: is called scope resolution operator which is a fancy way of
# saying it tells Ruby where you're looking for a specific bit of code
#

#    to the console.
