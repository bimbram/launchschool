# How It Works
#===============================================================================
#
# -Our last program doesn't change its behavior in reaction ot the environment
# (the collection of all variables and their values that exist in the program at
# a given time)
# -Control flow gives us the flexibility we're looking for
# -Control flow can select different outcomes depending on information the user types
# the result of a computation, or the value returned by another part of the program

# 1. Check out the code in the editor. There's some new syntax there, but we'll
# bet you can guess what it does. Click Run to see the program in action! (Go ahead
# and give Ruby an integerâ€”that is, a positive or negative number with no decimal bit.)

  puts "You picked zero!"
