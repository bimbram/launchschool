-The most important principle in teaching programming is to separate concepts as
much as possible so that the programmer-to-be has to learn only one concept at a
time. This is much easier to said than done

-When we know something, there were just so many thing we're used to that we often
realize when we were introducing a new concepts

-Many of the ideas in programming could be taught meaningfully independent of the
others

-In teaching, it's important to teach only one way to do something. The fewer things
you teach a new programmer, the more creative and clever they have with the primitive
bits they do know.

-The prefect exercise creates an itch you can't help but scratch
